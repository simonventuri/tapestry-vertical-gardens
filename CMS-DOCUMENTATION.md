## Technical Implementation

### Authentication
- The CMS uses the existing admin authentication system
- Sessions are maintained across page refreshes
- Automatic logout handling

### Data Persistence
- Content is stored in Redis with the key `home:content`
- Default content is returned if no custom content exists
- Fallback mechanisms ensure the site always displays content

### Image Storage
- Images are uploaded to `/public/images/`
- Filename format: `fieldname-timestamp-random.extension`
- Automatic file validation (images only, 5MB limit)

### Error Handling
- Graceful fallbacks if Redis is unavailable
- User-friendly error messages
- Automatic retry mechanisms

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Changes not appearing on the website**
   - Make sure you clicked "Save Changes"
   - Check if there are any error messages
   - Try refreshing the page

2. **Image upload failing**
   - Check file size (must be under 5MB)
   - Ensure file is a valid image format
   - Check if you have proper admin permissions

3. **CMS not loading**
   - Verify you're logged in as admin
   - Check if Redis is connected
   - Look for error messages in the browser console

### Default Content Reset
If you need to restore the original content:
1. Go to the Content Management page
2. Click "Reset to Default" 
3. Confirm the action
4. The original content will be restored

## Security

- All CMS endpoints require admin authentication
- File uploads are restricted to image types only
- Input validation on all form fields
- CSRF protection through cookie-based authentication

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Backups**: Save important content changes externally
2. **Image Optimization**: Use appropriately sized images to maintain site performance
3. **Content Testing**: Preview changes on the live site after saving
4. **SEO Considerations**: Keep meta descriptions and alt text meaningful
5. **Mobile Testing**: Verify content displays well on mobile devices
